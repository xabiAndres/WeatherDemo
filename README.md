# WeatherDemo
Building a Today Widget Weather App

- Use of openweather.org free API to aggregate weather information. The API returns weather data for a particular location in JSON format.
- Creation of an embedded framework, which can be use across the container and the extension app.
- Create a Today Extension template to show the current location weather.
- Use of UserDefaults and App Groups to enable data sharing between the container app and app extension.
